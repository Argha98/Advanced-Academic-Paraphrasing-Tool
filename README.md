----------------------------

**1\. Project Overview**
------------------------

**Title**
---------

Humanized LLM-Powered Academic Paraphrasing System with Quality Assessment

**Description**
---------------

An advanced paraphrasing tool designed for academic research that combines large language models (Llama 3.3 70B) with humanization post-processing to generate high-quality, plagiarism-free paraphrases while preserving original meaning and technical accuracy.

**Version**
-----------

1.0.0 (February 2026)

**Author**
----------

Argha Mukherjee - Computer Science & Machine Learning

**Repository Type**
-------------------

Kaggle Notebook (GPU-accelerated)

**2\. Objective**
-----------------

**Primary Objectives**
----------------------

1.  **Preserve Original Meaning**: Generate paraphrases that maintain 78-92% semantic similarity to source text
    
2.  **Avoid Plagiarism**: Ensure 30-55% lexical overlap (40%+ word variation from original)
    
3.  **Humanize Output**: Remove AI-generated artifacts and robotic phrasing to produce natural, human-like text
    
4.  **Multi-Style Generation**: Provide three distinct paraphrasing styles (Academic, Concise, Technical)
    
5.  **Quality Assessment**: Real-time metrics for lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and humanness scores
    

**Secondary Objectives**
------------------------

*   Protect technical elements (equations, citations, URLs) during paraphrasing
    
*   Provide batch processing capabilities for multiple paragraphs
    
*   Generate reproducible results with source citation reminders
    
*   Enable offline/online hybrid operation (local embeddings + API models)
